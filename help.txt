Can-It is a tool for using canned responses.

Usage
    can-it command [parameters]

Commands

        Prints the names and index numbers of all canned response templates from the config file.

    peek [canned response]
        Prints the specified canned response template.
        Provide the name or index number of a canned response template as a parameter.

    use [canned response]
        Uses the specified canned response template.
        Provide the name or index number of a canned response template as a parameter.

        The canned response template will be printed to the console, and you will be prompted
        to provide a replacement value for each placeholder in it. As you fill in each
        placeholder, the canned response template will update to include what you entered.
        Once you fill in the last placeholder, the complete canned response will be copied
        to your clipboard.

Config
    Add your canned repsonse templates to the config file, following the example in example-can-it.json.
    Templates may contain any number of placeholders, and you can even define default placeholder
    values if necessary.
